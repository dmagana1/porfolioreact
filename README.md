# Create React App Portfolio

## This assingment was to create a portfolio using React App

# Problems 
#### I did run into a few problems I didnt relized that you couldnt do all the regular fucntion with bootstrap using react, and there were things I wanted to do to make my react portfolio look better, but it didnt work or it would throw an error up on the screen. I had to change my project around and create a simpler version of what I had orginally coded out, but that's ok, because I was able to learn new things and see what worked and didnt work with react.
